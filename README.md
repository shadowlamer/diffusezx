# ZX-Spectrum Art Generation with Stable Diffusion

Welcome to my ZX-Spectrum art generation project! Stable diffusion is a state-of-the-art AI technique that can generate images based on textual descriptions. In this project, I have combined it with a ZX Spectrum style prompt generator to create ZX Spectrum inspired images.

The script takes a text description of the ZX Spectrum scene and generates an image based on the provided description. Some examples of the generated images are shown below:

Example 1: A cute cat

Example 2: A Solar system

Example 3: A sea shore
